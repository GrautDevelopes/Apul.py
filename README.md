# Apul.py
Apul (Automatic PopUp Logger) automatically gets tech support scammer popups and their numbers from blobar redirectors and logs them to a console or file.
# Usage
`python Apul.py http://pete.com/ pete.com.log`
# Not getting anything?
Change the useragent in the config on line 18 to another browser, preferrably Chrome or IE/Edge. You also have to run this on an United States or Canadian connection on a residential ip. Otherwise it might be a slow day for popups. You should also check back and update the script often, at one point the script bricked when they changed the way they redirected. So it's important to keep updating to the newest version.
